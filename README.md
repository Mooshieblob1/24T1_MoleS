# Mole Survivor

Mole Survivor is a cross-platform digging game inspired by traditional NES digging games and the modern game "Diggerman". It combines 2D scrolling down digging gameplay with a mix of 3D and 2D pixelated assets.

## Gameplay

The core mechanics of Mole Survivor are similar to traditional digging games. Players control a character who must dig through soil cubes to progress. The character, soil cubes, items, and enemies are represented by 3D models.

## Aesthetics

Mole Survivor features two aesthetic design elements:

1. **Background Image**: Each level will have a large 2D pixelated background image behind the soil cubes. As the player digs down, parts of the background image will be revealed, adding to the story narrative of each level/region.

2. **UX and UI Design**: The overall user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design of the game will have an Arcade-Style feeling, reminiscent of classic arcade machines.
